				<h3><img src="w1870576/Pics/Soccerplay.jpg" alt="pic" class="pic" width=300 height=200 >Soccer</h3>
				<p> Soccer (also known as football in certain countries) is one of the most popular sports in the world. It is a sport in which speed, strength, and skill are all combined. On a rectangular field, two teams of 11 players compete to score by kicking or "heading" a ball into the other team's goal. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball, and only within the penalty area that surrounds the goal. The team that scores the most goals is the winner. </p>
				<p> The game is played on a pitch, which is a rectangular surface with goals on each ends. The goal lines are the lines that go from one end of the pitch to the other, while the touchlines are the lines that run perpendicular to the goal lines. Grass is frequently used as the playing surface. The goalkeeper must be named before the game and must wear a different color jersey, shorts, and socks than the rest of the squad. A strip is made up of the same jersey, shorts, and socks used by all outfield players on the same team. To strengthen their grip on the surface, all players wear boots with studs or cleats. </p>

				<h3><img src="w1870576/Pics/cricketplay.jpg" alt="pic" class="pic" width=300 height=200> Cricket </h3>
				<p> Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport in which two teams of eleven players compete on a field with a 20-meter pitch in the middle and two wickets at either end, each with two bails balanced on three stumps. The game begins when a fielding team member, known as the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch to the wicket at the opposite end, with a "over" being completed once they have done so lawfully six times. The batting side features one player at each end of the pitch, with the player opposite the bowler attempting to hit the ball with a bat.</p>
			    <p> The batting team scores runs when the ball hits the field's boundary or when the two batters switch ends of the pitch, resulting in one run. The goal of the fielding team is to prevent runs from being scored and to dismiss each batter. Being bowled, which occurs when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, as well as the fielding side catching a hit ball before it reaches the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run, are all methods of dismissal. The innings finishes after 10 hitters have been struck out, and the sides switch roles.</p>

				<h3><img src="w1870576/Pics/basketballplay.jpg" alt="pic" class="pic" width=300 height=200> Basketball </h3>
				<p> Basketball is a team sport in which two teams of five players compete on a rectangular court with the primary goal of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop, which is 10 feet high and mounted to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. Field goals are for two points unless they are made from behind the three-point line, in which case they are worth three points. When a player gets fouled or is called for a technical foul, the clock stops and the player is allowed one, two, or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of regulation play wins, but if the score is tied at the completion of regulation play, an extra session of play is required.</p>
			    <p> Each team's five players are assigned to one of five positions. The center is usually the tallest player, the power forward is the second-tallest and strongest, the small forward is slightly shorter but more agile, and the shooting guard and point guard are the shortest players or best ball handlers, executing the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Players can play three-on-three, two-on-two, or one-on-one informally. </p>

				<h3><img src="w1870576/Pics/rugbyplay.jpg" alt="pic" class="pic" width=300 height=200> Rugby </h3>
				<p> Rugby was created as a football variant in the early nineteenth century. It is a team sport in which each participant has the opportunity to go all out. Rugby is a 15-a-side team sport played by 15 players. The purpose of the game is to get the ball behind the other team's try line and into the in-goal area. Rugby may be played with the ball in hand or by kicking it. When the ball is carried in the hand, however, it can only be hurled or passed backwards. This is because the player's progress, not the ball, is the most important factor in this sport. That is one distinction between rugby and American football, despite the fact that the two are sometimes mistaken by non-experts.</p>
				<p> The ball is tossed in, and the forwards pull one of their teammates above the scrum, where he attempts to collect and pass the ball to a teammate. When the ball has gone into touch, this is known as a line-out. There is no tackling, that is, no bodily contact, during the scrimmage at the end of practice. This is to protect these inexperienced people from being hurt. This player locates the appropriate place, catches the ball, and plants it in the in-goal area. Points may be earned by even the most inexperienced players. It's simple to get into rugby. Anyone may participate, and the earlier you begin, the better. Rugby is an excellent activity to begin as a youngster since it is a great way to become in shape.</p>

				<h3> <img src="w1870576/Pics/badmintonplay.jpg" alt="pic" class="pic" width=300 height=200> Badminton </h3>
				<p> Badminton is a racquet sport in which players hit a shuttlecock through a net with racquets. The most prevalent varieties of the game are "singles"  and "doubles" . Badminton is frequently played as a casual outdoor sport in a yard or on the beach, with serious games taking place on a rectangular indoor court. The shuttlecock is struck with the racquet and landed within the other team's half of the court to earn points.Before the shuttlecock travels over the net, each team may only hit it once. Play ends when the shuttlecock hits the floor or when the umpire, service judge, or the other side calls a fault.</p>
				<p> The shuttlecock is a feathered (or, in casual bouts, plastic) projectile that flies differently than most other sports' balls. The feathers, in particular, produce significantly greater drag, forcing the shuttlecock to descend more quickly. In comparison to the balls used in other racquet sports, shuttlecocks have a high peak speed. The shuttlecock's flight is the sport's distinguishing feature. </p>
